# Lounge-Lit House Concerts (Staging)

This repository contains the staging version of the Lounge-Lit House Concerts landing page.
It is temporarily hosted at:
[https://heartember.github.io/lounge-lit-concerts/](https://heartember.github.io/lounge-lit-concerts/)

This version exists to experiment with layout, graphics, domains, and newsletter integration before creating a new production repo under Eric’s own accounts (GitHub, Namecheap, and Buttondown).

## Purpose of This Repo

* Provide a clean mockup of the future house-concert website.
* Test different hero images, branding tones, and layout structures.
* Integrate a Buttondown email signup form for subscriber collection.
* Serve as a reference for when the site is rebuilt later under Eric’s ownership.

## File Structure

```
/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
└── images/
    ├── hero-jungle-waterfall.png
    └── logo-circle.png  (may be replaced or removed later)
```

## How to Update Content

* Edit text inside index.html
  The main content lives in the hero section and can be updated without touching CSS.

* Replace images in /images
  Keep filenames the same so index.html doesn’t need to change.

* Style changes
  Modify css/style.css. This repo is intentionally minimal so styling stays centralized.

* Add any simple JavaScript
  Use js/main.js. For now it is a placeholder.

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages.
Any push to the main branch automatically updates the public staging link.

## To-Do Before Production

1. Decide on the final domain name.
2. Create Eric’s own accounts (GitHub, Namecheap, Buttondown).
3. Rebuild the site in a new repo owned by Eric.
4. Repoint Buttondown form action to his newsletter list.
5. Update favicon, logo, and hero image once Eric finalizes branding.

## Notes

* This is a non-permanent staging environment and may be deleted after production launch.
* No sensitive data should be stored in this repo.
* Once the new production repo exists, all assets can be migrated easily.

If you'd like, I can also write a more polished or more technical README, or one written in Eric’s voice instead of yours.
